# K-Means Clustering ROA
Clustering of Return on Assets (ROA) performance for credit unions with $7-15B in assets using NCUA call report data
In an effort to identify similarly performing ROA credit unions, K-Means is one method that can be helpful to identify not only similarly sized and performing credit unions, but similarly sized and better or worse performing credit unions as well.
 
One interesting phenomenon is the lower ROA performance as credit unions approach the $10B mark.  In the Q1 2023 cycle used in this example, there are then two clusters post $10B - one higher and one lower performing. As previously mentioned, there are a number of factors that cause different performance levels (geography, local economic factors, strategies, etc.). Therefore this probably isn't definitive however something that may be worth further exploration.
